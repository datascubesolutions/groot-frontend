## Project Summary
Groot Analytics is a professional data engineering and AI consultancy specializing in modern cloud data platforms. The project is a high-end service website built with Next.js, featuring a sophisticated design with animations and a focus on enterprise-grade solutions.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- **Language:** JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Animations:** Framer Motion, Lottie
- **Icons:** Lucide React
- **Infrastructure:** Microsoft Azure Stack (Azure, Fabric, Databricks, AI Foundry)

## Architecture
- `src/app`: Next.js App Router pages and layouts.
- `src/components/sections`: Reusable high-level page sections (Hero, Services, etc.).
- `src/components/ui`: Low-level atomic UI components.
- `src/lib/constants`: Configuration and static data.

## User Preferences
- **Professional Aesthetic:** Prefers clean, standard, and professional enterprise designs over overly long or complex animations.
- **Technology Focus:** Primary focus on Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Fabric, Azure Databricks, and Microsoft AI Foundry.

## Project Guidelines
- **Modern Typography:** Use distinctive and beautiful fonts.
- **Section Length:** Keep sections concise and purposeful. Hero sections should not be excessively long unless justified by high-impact content.
- **No Comments:** Avoid adding comments to code unless explicitly requested.

## Common Patterns
- **Lazy Loading:** Sections on the homepage are lazy-loaded with Suspense and skeletons.
- **Theming:** Uses CSS variables for theming with a "mint" and "groot-dark" palette.
